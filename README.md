## Notes

* For projects with more than **999 tracks**, increase `MAX_TRACKS` in the '.js' file.
* I‚Äôm more of a musician than a coder, just made this to help me and my friends. Feel free to open a pull request :)
* When opening a project, tracks might recolor automatically. Disable the script first if you don‚Äôt want that.
* If a track didn‚Äôt recolor, click any other track and it should update.

## Credits

Based on an idea by **None Bits**. Big thanks!

His version recolored tracks when creating them inside groups,  
and **autocolor :)** takes it a step further by updating colors when tracks move or when group colors change.
